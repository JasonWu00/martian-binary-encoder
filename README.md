# martian-binary-encoder
A small Python script I wrote for a TTRPG campaign I am a part of.

Note that, due to unexpected interactions between the Python input() function and Windows Subsystem to Linux, the decoder function forcibly truncates inputted blackboxes to 1395 characters. Any additional characters are lost. You may wish to use the Streamlit application or any other command line interface (Windows, VSCode, possibly others that I have not yet tested).
